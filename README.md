## Lab49 `quickbits`: React & Redux + AG Grid client side update speed demo

This project is a `quickbits` showcase of a [React](https://reactjs.org/) & [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) + [AG Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) application, specifically configured to show off efficient grid rendering techniques.

As with all `quickbits` projects, this is only intended to show off a single concept, for reference in your own projects.

What this project is attempting to do is show how fast rendering can be acheived with AG Grid by leveraging a simple Redux store in a React UI. Additionally, we use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to make getting started as easy as possible.
